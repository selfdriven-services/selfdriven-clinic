!! UPDATE FOR CLINIC

## 2. Background & Rationale  

### 2.1 Context  

Global health systems face compounding pressures: aging populations, chronic conditions, and rising costs.  
**selfdriven Health (SDH)** envisions a shift toward participatory, data-empowered health management.

Research domains highlighted on [selfdriven.health](https://www.selfdriven.health/) include:

- Practitioner-in-the-Loop healthcare models  
- Verifiable self-generated observations  
- AI-enabled behavior change and adaptive feedback loops  

**Supporting studies:**  
- *Royal Society of Medicine (2022)* — SDH improves outcomes and reduces costs.  
- *News-Medical (2022)* — Patient-generated data can enhance system sustainability.

### 2.2 Why ORG + Token  

A selfdriven ORG enables transparent, community-governed research.  
The **SDH token** aligns incentives by rewarding participation, governance, and data contribution.

| **Feature** | **Value** |
|--------------|-----------|
| On-chain transparency | Verifiable allocation and results |
| Token-based incentives | Rewards for data and engagement |
| Community voting | Collective decision-making on experiments |
| Ethical compliance | Built-in consent and accountability |
| Scalable model | Global, modular, open-source |

---

## 3. Objectives  

1. Deploy a ORG-governed **R&D fund** powered by the SDH token.  
2. Execute **two pilot studies** aligned with selfdriven.health research domains.  
3. Measure outcomes in engagement, participation, and data quality.  
4. Publish open findings and DAO governance whitepaper.  
5. Validate the **tokenised R&D model** for sustainable research funding.

## 5. Methodology & Work Plan  

| **Phase** | **Months** | **Deliverables** |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **0 · Setup & Design** | Month 1 | Form R&D committee (University + DAO) · Define governance & token model · Smart-contract design & audit · Ethics & consent protocol · Community call for proposals |
| **1 · Selection & Onboarding** | Month 2 | DAO vote to select pilot studies · Recruit participants · Define instruments & pipelines · Baseline data collection |
| **2 · Pilot Execution** | Months 3–4 | Conduct experiments · Token distribution · Monitor AI / practitioner feedback loops · Weekly validation |
| **3 · Analysis & Reflection** | Month 5 | Data cleaning · Statistical & qualitative evaluation · Governance reflection |
| **4 · Reporting & Scale-Up** | Month 6 | Publish whitepaper · Host symposium · DAO vote on next-round funding |

## 7. Governance Model  

### ORG Architecture  

- **Governance Token:** SDH
- **Voting Model:** Quadratic with identity voting  
- **Treasury:** Smart-contract-controlled multi-sig  
- **Roles:**  
  - *Facilitators* — oversee milestones  
  - *Contributors* — submit research proposals  
  - *Participants* — engage & earn tokens  

### Reward Framework  

| **Contribution Type** | **Reward Mechanism** |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Research proposal accepted | Milestone-based SDH grants |
| Active participation | Micro-incentives (per verified action) |
| Governance engagement | Token reward / reputation gain |
| Publication or tool creation | Bonus SDH / credential NFT |

## 8. Budget Estimate  

| **Category** | ** Phase 1 Cost (USD)** | **Description** |
|---------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Research & Personnel | - | Academic & technical staff |
| Smart-Contract Dev & Audit | - | DAO + token logic |
| Infrastructure & Analytics | - | Cloud + dashboards |
| Participant Compensation | -| SDH / fiat hybrid |
| Legal / Compliance / Ethics | - | Privacy, IRB, contracts |
| Community Engagement | - | Workshops, comms |
| Contingency | - | 10 % reserve |
| **Total** | **100 000 USD** | — |

## 9. Funding Partners  

Potential sources include:  

- **MRFF – Emerging Priorities & Consumer-Driven Research**  
- **NHMRC Partnership Grants**  
- **Cardano Project Catalyst / Blockchain R&D Funds**  
- **Philanthropic Innovation Foundations** (Wellcome, Minderoo, etc.)  
- **Corporate HealthTech Collaborations**

---

## 10. Risks & Mitigation  

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
|-----------|----------------|
| Low community engagement | Outreach + tiered incentives |
| Governance centralization | Quadratic voting + delegation caps |
| Privacy / legal exposure | Ethics approval + encrypted data |
| Smart-contract vulnerabilities | Security audits + staged rollout |
| Regulatory uncertainty | Legal review + adaptive policy |
| Budget overruns | Milestone-based disbursement |

---

## 11. Expected Outcomes  

By **End Phase 1**:  
- Operational DAO-governed research fund  
- Two pilot studies completed  
- Public whitepaper + open-data release  
- Demonstrated governance transparency  
- Template for future DAO-led research  

**Long-Term Vision:**  
A perpetual **selfdriven Health Research Network** — funding, governing, and validating decentralized health innovation through tokenized collaboration.

---

## 12. Next Steps  

1. Finalize MoU between DAO and University.  
2. Deploy minimal DAO contracts (Cardano / compatible).  
3. Recruit founding researchers and participants.  
4. Apply for matched funding (public + Web3).  
5. Publish charter and call for participation.
